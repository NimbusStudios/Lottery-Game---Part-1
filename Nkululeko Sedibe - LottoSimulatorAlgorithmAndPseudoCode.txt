Human-Readable Algorithm:

1. Initialization:
    - Load existing tickets and draw history from localStorage.
    - Set up event listeners for buttons.

2. User Mode:
    - When the user selects User Mode:
        1. Hide the landing page and show the user mode interface.
        2. Generate a grid of 52 number buttons.
        3. Allow the user to select exactly 6 numbers.
        4. Allow the user to specify the number of boards (1-10) and if they want Lotto Plus 1 and/or Lotto Plus 2.
        5. Validate the number of selected numbers and boards.
        6. Generate tickets based on user selections and calculate the total cost.
        7. Display a summary of the selected numbers, boards, and cost.
        8. Confirm the purchase and save the ticket information to localStorage.

3. Admin Mode:
    - When the admin selects Admin Mode:
        1. Hide the landing page and show the admin mode interface.
        2. Allow the admin to simulate a lotto draw by generating 6 random winning numbers.
        3. Display the winning numbers.
        4. Check all saved tickets against the winning numbers and identify winners.
        5. Display winning tickets and notify the admin if there are winners.
        6. Save the draw results and update the draw history in localStorage.

4. General Functions:
    - Generate a random set of 6 unique numbers between 1 and 52.
    - Calculate the total cost based on the number of boards and Lotto Plus options.
    - Check if a ticket is a winner by comparing its numbers with the winning numbers.
    - Persist and retrieve data from localStorage.
